# Hello!

This is my portfolio website, a work in progress. It uses React as its frontend UI, which I plan to use to allow me to easily route to subpages as well as implement a contact form. In the future, I may add more interactivity.

#### Launch development server:

`npm run start`

#### Deploy changes to gh-pages branch:

`npm run deploy`
